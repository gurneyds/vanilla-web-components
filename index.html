		<h1>Vanilla Web Components</h1>
		<head>
			This site demonstrates native web components and how they might be constructed. Each section demonstrates
			a potential solution when working with native web components.

			<section>
				<h2><a href="subComponents.html">Sub Components</a></h2>
				A component may be complex and need to be broken down into several sub-components. These sub-components
				will probably need to be fed information from the parent component. This sample demonstrates how sub-components
				can be children of a parent component and receive configuration information as well as operational information.
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2><a href="selfContained.html">Self Contained components</a></h2>
				Some components will be able to stand alone and have no need for interaction with other elements on the page.
				The <img> tag is an example of this behavior. The component is configured via attributes with all of the
				information necessary for it's operation.
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2><a href="proxyComponent.html">Proxy Web Component</a></h2>
				It may make sense to externalize the gathering of the data outside of a component. The purpose of a proxy
				component would be to gather the necessary data and then pass it on to it's children.
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2><a href="proxyComponentWithInterceptor.html">Proxy Web Component with event interception	</a></h2>
				The data needs of the children components may not match the provided data. An event intercepter is demonstrated
				that can transform the original data into a form that is consumable by the children components.

			<section>
				<h2><a href="translations.html">Translation demonstration</a></h2>
				Translation strings come from a global Frontier variable and are passed down to the children components

				<h2><a href="reduxProxyDemo.html">Redux proxy demonstration</a></h2>
        This proxy demonstrates how Redux might be used with web components
			</section>

      <section>
				<h2><a href="reduxGlueDemo.html">Redux glue demonstration</a></h2>
        This proxy demonstrates a redux glue component that encapsulates the redux functionaly and hooks up the components using meta-data
